n this project, we will aim to provide a way to automate the way in which noticeboard messages can be updated, deleted, or removed. Provide access to students/ professors or administrative etc officers to different features which will provide various information.

We will also provide roles and based on them permissions will be granted to add or remove data to notice board features.

You can also visit & download the Notice Board PHP project on Online College Complaints Suggestions and Compliances.
